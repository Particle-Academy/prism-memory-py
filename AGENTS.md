# AGENTS.md — prism-memory-py

The Python port of
[`particle-academy/prism-memory`](https://github.com/Particle-Academy/prism-memory).
Read the shared agent guide in `prism-parity/docs/AGENTS.md` first: the
boundary, the satellite map, the rules that bind, and the review skills.

## Gates — run them on EXIT CODES

```sh
python -m ruff check .
python -m ruff format --check .
python -m mypy --strict src tests
python -m pytest
```

Never pipe a gate into `head`/`tail`/`grep` and read `$?` — that is the
FILTER's exit code, not the gate's. Redirect to a file, echo `$?`, then look.

## What this package holds

Vectors in a byte-identical storage format, the VectorStore contract, an
in-memory store, binary signatures, and relevance/recency weighting.

## The rule that binds every port here

**Faithful to the reference, or a DOCUMENTED divergence — never a quiet one.**
Where this port does something the reference does not, the reason is in the
code and in the envelope's port gaps register. A difference nobody wrote down
is drift, and drift is what this whole effort exists to prevent.
